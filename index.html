         can increase a person's risk of heart disease
         as well as many other non-oral diseases.</p>

    When it comes to dental treatment, many people make the mistake of picking the most affordable dental care without ensuring high-quality dental<br>
    services with an experienced dental team.When you entrust your oral health care to a good-quality professional, you know that s/he will offer you honest<br>
    feedback. Case in point is the need for dealing with dental stains or small holes in the teeth. Veneers can fix these problems. When insurance doesnâ€™t provide<br>
    coverage for the cost, and money is tight, there may be other affordable dental care options to try first
